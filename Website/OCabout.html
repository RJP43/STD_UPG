                        college or university with an active chapter. In order to present at
                        conference and apply for graduate school scholarships after graduation from
                        Pitt-Greensburg you will need to join the Alumni chapter, <a

                <div id="toggle1">
                    <p class="alt">In addition to the prestige of membership in an international
                        honor society, there are many other benefits of affiliation including
                        thousands of dollars in scholarship and award opportunities, regional and
                        national conferences, as well as internship and publication possibilities.
                        One especially noteworthy benefit of membership is that students are invited
                        to submit papers for presentation at Sigma Tau Delta’s annual spring
                        convention, held each year in one of the Society’s six regions of the
                        country. Students selected to present their work in this national venue also
                        have the opportunity to win convention writing awards and to attend
                        presentations and workshops by nationally recognized authors. In summary,
                        Sigma Tau Delta is about recognition and opportunity, and is dedicated to
                        making a real difference in the life of each and every Sigma Tau Deltan.</p>
