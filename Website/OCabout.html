                    <h2>Celebrating 25 Years!</h2>
                    <p class="alt">At the 2016 International Convention in Minneapolis, we were
                        recognized for being an active chapter of Sigma Tau Delta for twenty-five
                        years! <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/">Dr. Beshero-Bondar</a> was also
                        recognized for her ten years of service to Sigma Tau Delta as our faculty
                        advisor.</p>

                    <div id="toggle1">
                        <p class="alt">In addition to the prestige of membership in an international
                        honor society, there are many other benefits of affiliation including
                        thousands of dollars in scholarship and award opportunities, regional and
                        national conferences, as well as internship and publication possibilities.
                        One especially noteworthy benefit of membership is that students are invited
                        to submit papers for presentation at Sigma Tau Delta’s annual spring
                        convention, held each year in one of the Society’s six regions of the
                        country. Students selected to present their work in this national venue also
                        have the opportunity to win convention writing awards and to attend
                        presentations and workshops by nationally recognized authors. In summary,
                        Sigma Tau Delta is about recognition and opportunity, and is dedicated to
                        making a real difference in the life of each and every Sigma Tau Deltan.</p>
