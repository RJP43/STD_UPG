                <h2>Alpha Alpha Delta Chapter Events</h2>
                <h3>Bi-Annual Book Wallow:</h3>
                <p class="eventPage">At least once every semester we gather to rummage and wallow through the books collected in our <a href="http://www.betterworldbooks.com/">Better World Books</a>' bins. We never know the treasures we will find, but it always turns out to be a great time of chapter bonding and fund-raising. The books that do not meet Better World Books' standards get sent to local community book collection programs, which in the past have included:</p>
                <ul class="eventPage">
                    <li><a href="http://www.privateindustrycouncil.com/family_literacy.html">The Private Industry Council</a>: They focus their energies on adult education to benefit the workforce of Westmoreland County.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.blackburncenter.org/">The Blackburn Center</a>: They assist individuals suffering from domestic and sexual violence.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.basd.org/">Brownsville Area School District</a>: A local school district that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville_Area_School_District">according to the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center 64.7% of the Districtâ€™s pupils live below the Federal Poverty Level as shown by their eligibility for the federal free or reduced price school meal programs in 2012</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Sigma Tau Delta International Convention:</h3>
                <p class="eventPage">This is the holy grail of Sigma Tau Delta events. Members of the honor society are given the opportunity to submit critical papers, creative writing, and discussion panel proposals for the international conference held each spring. It provides the perfect backdrop for students, faculty, and writers to explore the various disciplines of English language and literature. For more information regarding the annual conference, please visit <a href="http://www.english.org/sigmatd/events/index.shtml">Sigma Tau Delta's convention</a> site, or the <a href="http://www.englishconvention.org">main convention</a> site itself. Visit the pages used by our chapter's Digital Humanists at the <a target="_blank" href="2015Convention/index_conventionPrep.xhtml">2015 International Convention in New Mexico</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="2016Convention/index.html">2016 International Convention in Minnesota</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="2017Convention/RaisingTheDead.html">2017 International Convention in Kentucky</a>.</p>
                <h3>Member Induction Ceremony:</h3>
                <p class="eventPage">Inductions for the Alpha Alpha Delta Chapter of Sigma Tau Delta are usually held twice during the academic year, once each fall and spring semester. After meeting <a href="OCabout.html">eligibility requirements</a> for the prestigious honor society, students are formally inducted into Sigma Tau Delta during a ceremony run by the chapter's student officers. New members are welcomed into the honor society with a feast, and it is quite common for current members and faculty to select short readings for the occasion.</p>
                <h3>Fall Harvest / Devil's Night:</h3>
                <p class="eventPage">Usually sponsored in part by the <a href="http://www.library.pitt.edu/friends-millstein-library">Friends of the Millstein Library</a>, our Devil's Night is a celebration that Sigma Tau Delta holds every year around Halloween. Stories, poems, and other writings that are spooky, frightening, eerie, or in some other way jarring are read out-loud a dark and modestly decorated room. Participants and guests are encouraged to dress in costume. And of course, no celebration would be complete without food, which participants and guests are encouraged to bring! Prizes are awarded for the best costumes and readings. In recent years, we have missed the opportunity to have the event close to Halloween/Devil's night and have adjusted accordingly by hosting a Fall Harvest event. Students and Faculty bring stories, poems, and other writings with a fall theme, and enjoy refreshments associated with autumn.</p>
                <h3>Banned Books:</h3>
                <p class="eventPage">This is a reading contest and scavenger hunt to celebrate Banned Books Week, hosted by the American Library Association, and to join in the protest against the banning and challenging of books around the world. In order to compete in the contest, participants must find a banned or challenged book (banned or challenge ANYWHERE, ANYTIME in history). Naturally, they must choose a passage to read. Readings are judged for a number of qualities, such as their shock value, literary merit, and reading performance. The Alpha Alpha Delta Chapter awards fine editions of sultry, steamy banned books to those who deliver the top three readings and/or gift cards. The event is often kicked off by "The Singing of Smut" by Dr. Sayre Greenfield. More information about Banned Books Week can be found at the <a href="http://www.ala.org/bbooks/bannedbooksweek">American Library Association's website</a>.</p>
