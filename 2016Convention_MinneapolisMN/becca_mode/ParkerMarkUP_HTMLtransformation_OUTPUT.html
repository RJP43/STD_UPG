        |   Suddenly, <span class="person">I</span> stopped thinking about <span class="love">Love</span>, (line: 1)<br />
      after so many years of only that, (line: 2)<br />
      after thinking that nothing else mattered.  |    (line: 3)<br />
      <br />
        |   And what was <span class="person">I</span> thinking of when <span class="person">I</span> stopped (line: 4)<br />
      thinking about <span class="love">Love</span>?  |      |   <span class="death">Death</span>, of courseâ€”what else (line: 5)<br />
      could take <span class="love">Love</span>'s place?  |      |   What else could hold such force?  |    (line: 6)<br />
      <br />
        |   <span class="person">I</span> thought about how far away <span class="death">Death</span> once (line: 7)<br />
      had seemed, how unexpected that it could (line: 8)<br /> happen to someone <span class="person">I</span> knew quite well, (line: 9)<br />
      <br />
      how impossible that this should be the (line: 10)<br />
      normal thing, as natural as frost and (line: 11)<br />
      winter.  |      |   <span class="person">I</span> thought about the way we'd aged, (line: 12)<br />
      <br />
      how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew (line: 13)<br />
      dim; then (of course) my <span class="love">love</span>, <span class="person">I</span> thought of <span class="person">you</span>.  |    (line: 14)<br />
      <br />
