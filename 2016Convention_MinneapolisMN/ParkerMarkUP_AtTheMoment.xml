        <sent>Suddenly, <person type="speaker">I</person> stopped <w id="thought">thinking</w> about <w id="love">Love</w>,<lb/>
after so many years of only that,<lb/>
            after <w id="thought">thinking</w> that nothing else mattered.</sent><lb/>
        <stanzaEnd/>
        <sent>And what was <person type="speaker">I</person> <w id="thought">thinking</w> of when <person type="speaker">I</person> stopped<lb/>

        <stanzaEnd/>
        <sent><person type="speaker">I</person> <w id="thought">thought</w> about how far away <w id="death">Death</w> once<lb/>
had seemed, how unexpected that it could<lb/> happen to someone <person type="speaker">I</person> knew quite well,<lb/>
            <stanzaEnd/>
how impossible that this should be the<lb/>
normal thing, as natural as frost and<lb/>
            winter.</sent> <sent><person type="speaker">I</person> <w id="thought">thought</w> about the way we'd aged,<lb/>
            <stanzaEnd/>
how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew<lb/>
                dim; then (of course) my <w id="love">love</w>, <person type="speaker">I</person> <w id="thought">thought</w> of <person type="audience">you</person>.</sent><lb/>
