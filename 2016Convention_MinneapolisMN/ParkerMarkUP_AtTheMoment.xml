        <sent>Suddenly, <person type="speaker">I</person> stopped thinking about <w id="love">Love</w>,<lb/>
after so many years of only that,<lb/>
after thinking that nothing else mattered.</sent><lb/>
        <stanzaEnd/>
        <sent>And what was <person type="speaker">I</person> thinking of when <person type="speaker">I</person> stopped<lb/>
thinking about <w id="love">Love</w>?</sent> <sent><w id="death">Death</w>, of courseâ€”what else<lb/>
could take <w id="love">Love</w>'s place?</sent> <sent>What else could hold such force?</sent><lb/>
        <stanzaEnd/>
        <sent><person type="speaker">I</person> thought about how far away <w id="death">Death</w> once<lb/>
had seemed, how unexpected that it could<lb/> happen to someone <person type="speaker">I</person> knew quite well,<lb/>
            <stanzaEnd/>
how impossible that this should be the<lb/>
normal thing, as natural as frost and<lb/>
winter.</sent> <sent><person type="speaker">I</person> thought about the way we'd aged,<lb/>
            <stanzaEnd/>
how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew<lb/>
dim; then (of course) my <w id="love">love</w>, <person type="speaker">I</person> thought of <person type="audience">you</person>.</sent><lb/>
        <stanzaEnd/>
