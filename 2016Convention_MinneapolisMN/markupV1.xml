<body><stanza><line>Suddenly, I stopped thinking about Love,</line>
<line>after so many years of only that,</line>
<line>after thinking that nothing else mattered.</line></stanza>

<stanza><line>And what was I thinking of when I stopped</line>
<line>thinking about Love? Death, of courseówhat else</line>
<line>could take Loveís place? What else could hold such force?</line></stanza>

<stanza><line>I thought about how far away Death once</line>
<line>had seemed, how unexpected that it could</line>
<line>happen to someone I knew quite well,</line></stanza>

<stanza><line>how impossible that this should be the</line>
<line>normal thing, as natural as frost and</line>
<line>winter. I thought about the way weíd aged,</line></stanza>

<stanza><line>how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew</line>
<line>dim; then (of course) my love, I thought of you.</line></stanza></body>
