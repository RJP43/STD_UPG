Suddenly, I stopped thinking about Love,
after so many years of only that,
after thinking that nothing else mattered.
</lg>

<lg>
And what was I thinking of when I stopped
thinking about Love? Death, of course—what else
could take Love’s place? What else could hold such force?
</lg>

<lg>
I thought about how far away Death once
had seemed, how unexpected that it could
happen to someone I knew quite well,
</lg>

<lg>
how impossible that this should be the
normal thing, as natural as frost and
winter. I thought about the way we’d aged,
</lg>

<lg>
how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew
dim; then (of course) my love, I thought of you.
