            <sent num="1">Suddenly, I stopped thinking about <anth>Love</anth>,<line/> after so many years
                of only that,<line/> after thinking that nothing else mattered.</sent>
            <line/>
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <sent num="2">And what was I thinking of when I stopped<line/> thinking about
                <anth>Love</anth>?</sent>
            <sent num="3"><anth>Death</anth>, of course-what else<line/> could take <anth>Love's</anth>

            <sent num="4">What else could hold such force?</sent>

        <stanza>
            <sent num="5">I thought about how far away <anth>Death</anth> once<line/> had seemed, how
                unexpected that it could<line/> happen to someone I knew quite well,</sent><line/>
        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <sent num="5">how impossible that this should be the<line/> normal thing, as natural as frost
                and<line/> winter.</sent>
            <sent num="6">I thought about the way we'd aged,</sent>

        </stanza>

        <stanza>
            <sent num="6">how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew<line/> dim; then (of course) my love, I
                thought of you.</sent>
