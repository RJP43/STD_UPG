      <h2>BY JOYCE SUTPHEN</h2>
      <h3>Published by: Naming the Stars (Holy Cow! Press, 2004)</h3>
      <span class="sentence">Suddenly, I stopped thinking about Love, (line: 1)<br />
         after so many years of only that, (line: 2)<br />
         after thinking that nothing else mattered.</span> (line: 3)<br />
      <br /><br />
      <span class="sentence">And what was I thinking of when I stopped (line: 4)<br />
         thinking about Love?</span> <span class="sentence">Death, of courseâ€”what else (line: 5)<br />
         could take Love's place?</span> <span class="sentence">What else could hold such force?</span> (line: 6)<br />
      <br /><br />
      <span class="sentence">I thought about how far away Death once (line: 7)<br />
         had seemed, how unexpected that it could (line: 8)<br /> happen to someone I knew quite well, (line: 9)<br />
         <br /><br />
         how impossible that this should be the (line: 10)<br />
         normal thing, as natural as frost and (line: 11)<br />
         winter.</span> <span class="sentence">I thought about the way we'd aged, (line: 12)<br />
         <br /><br />
         how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew (line: 13)<br />
         dim; then (of course) my love, I thought of you.</span> (line: 14)<br />
